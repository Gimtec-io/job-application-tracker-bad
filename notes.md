# Notes

* When installing with create-react-app make sure to use matching version below. Otherwise, the setup seems to work, but Typescript is not installed.

```
Expected version "^10.13.0 || ^12.13.0 || ^14.15.0 || >=15.0.0". Got "12.7.0"
```

Use Grommet for a minimum style from the beginning. https://v2.grommet.io/
Followed the setup only for the theme, font and body reset.

DO NOT USE ANY CSS

First I started with Express hello world

https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices

Created first endpoints returning text

Populated the DB

Sometimes I started with how I wanted my code to read:

```javascript
// PENDING to create new status
const application = await Application.getById(req.params.id);
await application.update(req.body);
res.json(application);
```

They I would implement the methods `getById` and `update`.

I am not a fan of creating ids in the frontend. It's very convenient, but then the frontend knows too much and in case of change in how ids are created it also requires a change in the frontend.

With websites that is not a problem, yet with apps it might be a pproblems. Webistes everybody has the last version. Apps, everybody has a different version, which means that someone might try to create the new entity with the old way of creating ids.

This project does not focus on configuration. Hence, no linting, pre-commit, production config, typescript in backend etc. The project focuses on clean code.

DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the value of repetition. Build CRUD apps until you feel comfortable with them. It's the bread and butter of web developpment.

Avoid carets in package versions to make sure the versions are what you expect.

It's always nice to learn to use forms with a library.
It's nice to learn how to use a UI framework. Avoids spending time searching docs on how to do trivial things.
Leave yourself at least 1-2h at the end to ONLY play as a user with the app and read all the files.

Explain what each folder holds.

Readable render function of the route components
